# prework-study-guide

## Description

A repository of prework for the MSU coding bootcamp to make the organization of notes about the topics of this prework course easily categorized
This project was built as practice on incorporating JavaScript, CSS, and HTML elements together to create a functional webpage and to practice using GitHub for version control.
I learned a lot about using GitHub and Git Bash for version control, while the JS, CSS, and HTML were mostly review for me as I already basically understand those languages.
I don't think I can reasonably say that this "solved" any particular issue, as frankly this is a less efficient way by far to save notes on all of these subjects than in a simple word document, or better yet just a physical notebook.
But having an easily referenceable repository of notes is valuable in and of itself so I don't think this is in any way lost effort.

## Installation

This is a webpage and once one has a running internet browser once must simply download the project files and run the HTML page

## Usage

Refer to this page for notes on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. There are some slightly hidden features in the console, but those are simply practice projects and aren't particularly interactive.

## Credits

I used the MSU Coding bootcamp tutorial, which is proprietary and can't be linked here.
